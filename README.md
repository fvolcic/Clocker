# Clocker

Clocker is currently under development and is not 
stable yet. 

Clocker is a command line utility that allows a 
user to clocker in and clocker out easily. 
This makes for easy time tracking if you are working on 
something where the total time is important.

To use, simply run

```
clocker init # Initialize clocker application. 
clocker in # To clock in 
clocker out # To clock out

clocker reinit # to reinitialize clocker. 
```
All data is saved to `~/.clocker/clocker_file.json`
