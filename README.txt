Clocker is a WIP

Clocker is a command line application that allows users to 
easily clock in, clock out, and time check for applications. 

For example, you might run 

clocker set-timesheet contracting 
clocker in 

and then when your done you'd run 

clocker out

Maybe you'd like to know how much time you spent on a project, 
in which case you may run 

clocker timesheet last week

which would print out a bunch of timesheet information for you.

The goal of clocker is to provide simple timekeeping information for 
users.
